After putting question 1 into ChatGpt (3.5), I noticed that
it generated an incorrect answer, as well as fail to answer 
all of the questions asked. It internalized the first and second
question contexts, meaning the presence of the first and second 
batches of information, generating only one response. That response 
suggested that route 1 was the optimal route, which we know is 
incorrect. Since it generated faulty utilities, it tried to solve
the third part incorrectly. It felt that the data was worth 7 minutes
of waiting, which is a little arbitrary given the original estimates 
were off.
